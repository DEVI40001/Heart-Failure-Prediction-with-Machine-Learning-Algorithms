# Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms 

Introduction:

The dataset contains a wide range of features related to heart health and lifestyle choices. It includes patient specific details such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate age, gender, and indicators like diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, lifestyle factors like dietary habits, stress levels, exercise hours, and sedentary hours are included. Medical aspects such as previous heart problems, medication usage, and triglyceride levels are considered, along with socioeconomic factors like income and geographical attributes such as country, continent, and hemisphere.
The main objective of this project is to predict whether patients are at high or low risk of heart attacks depending on the many attributes mentioned below Table: 1: Dataset Attributes.
Tool Used:
I am using Jupyter notebook with Python kernel to perform all the tests. Sklearn will be used for primary library used for all data modelling and optimisation. NumPy, Scikit Learn, Seaborn and Pandas library were used for data loading, transformation and manipulation. Matplotlib and Seaborn will be used to plot visualisations.
Dataset Description:

The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle's "Heart Attack Risk Analysis" competition. It consists of 8963 instances, including 25 features and one target attribute. Since the number of features is large, I will give brief description of data set here and complete file can be download from the URL provided in references (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/data). Now, I will mention the feature name with a short description.
Target Feature== Heart Attack Risk
•	In this project I am going to analyze that how other feature of dataset affecting heart disease.

Methodology:

1.	Define the Problem
•	Clearly define the problem of detection of Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms based on relevant attributes.
•	Define the scope of the project and key attributes for success, including accuracy of predictions, model interpretability, and scalability.
2.	Data Collection and Preparation
•	Gather the data from authentic sources; here I am getting it from Kaggle  website (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis/data).
•	Pre-process and clean the data, handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3.	Exploration Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships between attributes (e.g: correlations between variables, distribution of data, etc.) which will help us build a better model.
•	Visualize data using various charts and graphs  (e.g: Scatterplot, Histogram, Bar Chart, Boxplot, Heatmap etc.) to understand distributions and correlations. 
•	Identify outliers that may affect model performance.
4.	Feature Engineering:
•	Addresses missing values by replacing them with new labels.
•	Identify and handle temporal variables.
•	Deal with rare categorical features. 
•	Standardize the values of variables to ensure uniformity.
5.	Modeling:
•	Select appropriate modeling techniques (e.g., linear regression, random forest) for predicting heart disease.
•	Use suitable metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error) to train and validate the model.
•	Optimize model parameters to enhance accuracy.



6.	Interpretation:
•	Analyze model outcomes and share your findings with relevant parties (e.g. which attribute have the biggest effects on Heart Attack Risk, how accurate is the model, etc.)
•	Identify areas for improvement and potential risks or limitations of the model.
7.	Deployment and Monitoring (next step)
•	Deploy the model in a live setting such as create a web app, API, etc.
•	Enhance reporting system to keep track of the model's efficacy and performance over time.
